        <p><i>A building, or edifice,is an enclosed structure with a roof and[1] walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory (although there's also portable buildings).[1] Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, prestige, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures.</i></p>
